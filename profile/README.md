## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the behind-the-scenes home of [Amphitheatre](https://amphitheatre.app)!

Our project is powered by several different repositories, which you're free to browse and explore.
Each component has a repository of its own (e.g.  [amphitheatre-app/amphitheatre](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amphitheatre) ) and one or more example repositories (e.g. [amp-example-go](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amp-example-go), [amp-example-rust](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amp-example-rust), [amp-example-java](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amp-example-java), [amp-example-python](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amp-example-python)).
The website source-code lives at [amphitheatre-app/website](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/website).

- If you want to open an issue, please go to the specific project and submit it, or if you're not sure you can submit it to the main project [amphitheatre-app/amphitheatre](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amphitheatre) repository.
  We can then triage it to the right place as appropriate.
- If you're looking to contribute, our [contributing page](https://docs.amphitheatre.app/contributing/) is a good starting point. 
  Be aware that different repositories have different contributing guidelines - y ou can always feel free to open an issue to ask how to help if you're unsure ðŸ™‚

Finally, please note that different parts of Amphitheatre are licenced under different licences, so please be mindful of the specific licence for any code you use!

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
